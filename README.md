# Facial Recognition-Based Unauthorized Entry Alert System  

## üìå Overview  
This project is a **real-time facial recognition security system** that detects and prevents unauthorized entry using **OpenCV and machine learning techniques**. It employs the **Haar Cascade Classifier** for face detection and the **LBPH algorithm** for recognition.  

The system provides **multi-layered alerts**:  
- **Tkinter GUI pop-ups** for local monitoring  
- **Email notifications** with sound alerts for remote security staff  
- **Push notifications (via Pushover API)** for instant mobile alerts  

It also maintains **robust entry logs**, supports **new registrations**, and offers a **user-friendly interface** for seamless management.
